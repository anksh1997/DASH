The kind of society we live in, one of the problem that we been facing is that the deaf people have difficulty taking education and adapting to new facilities provided by government and society itself. Even if some person is good at something, still he might not able to explain or share his talent among deaf people due to no formal interface between them. Not only this but the persons who have knowledge of the sign language also face a real challenge while teaching things to the deaf members under a 6-8 age. Considering tourism, many time as a solution for a language barrier, audio books are provided to tourist speaking different language from the native language in order to understand the significance of the particular place or the monument at that place. But there is no proper solution for the case of deaf people. A single deaf in a small village is not an issue. But considering the whole world, the no. of deaf are not negligible. Almost 3.8% of population is deaf. 155 of American population is suffering for complete or partial hearing loss. There must be a solution for this problem. Our motive is to help these people as much as possible. 


What are we going to do is, create a platform which will help deaf people in learning themselves and making them accustomed to the different things which are being kept apart from them for many years. Our motive can be listed below as:
•	As there is no universal sign language, our main motive will be creating a logical and anatomically consistent classification of hand forms and signs.
•	Creating a capable to finely differentiate sign within a cohesive framework for each.
•	Creating an efficient system which is any mobile or computer compatible. 
Our development will be based on the research completed by the Hamburg University, Germany. Which contains a development of HamNoSys (Hamburg Notation System) from scratch and also SiGML (Signing Gesture Markup Language) system in order to demonstrate the working. Basically we are going to develop an app which will act as a natural language processing for converting a natural language into a sign language with the help of a 3D avatar. Also we are implementing Google’s speech to text API in order to use the system with more ease.
